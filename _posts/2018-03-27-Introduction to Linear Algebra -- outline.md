Main References: Linear Algebra and It’s Applications (Fourth Edition) by Gilbert Strang
I will not follow the book line by line, so taking lecture notes will be a very beneficial practice.
Additional resources that I will use are the following:
• Linear Algebra Done Wright, Sheldon Axler, Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer, 2015
• Linear Algebra Done Wrong, Serge Treil
Free available at https://www.math.brown.edu/ treil/papers/LADW/book.pdf
• Linear Algebra, Larry Smith, Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer, 1998

Objectives: This courses' objectives are two fold: on one side it aims to teach linear algebra, on the other
side it aims to teach mathematical formalism and provide experience with mathematical proofs. A student
who successfully completes this course should be able to:
• Understand and utilize basic concepts of linear algebra such as vector spaces, linear independence,
orthogonality, projection and spectrum.
• Identify linear algebraic structure in applications.
• Carry out computations such as determinant of a matrix and inverse of a matrix.
• Read and write rigorous mathematical proofs.

Prerequisites: An open mind that enjoys to question and learn. We will together grow your mathematical
maturity and this will take some good amount of work. This course may be a bit challenging at times, but
it will certainly be a very rewarding process for you.

Tentative Course Outline:
* Basics of Vectors Spaces
* Linear Transformation and Matrices
* Systems of Linear Equations and Fundamental Subspaces
* Determinant
* Eigenvalues and Diagonalization
* Inner product Spaces, Orthogonality and Gram-Schmidt process
* Singular Value Decomposition
* Student Presentations (optional)
