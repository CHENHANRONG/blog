### Objectives: 
This courses' objectives are two fold: on one side it aims to teach linear algebra, on the other side it aims to teach mathematical formalism and provide experience with mathematical proofs. A student who successfully completes this course should be able to:
* Understand and utilize basic concepts of linear algebra such as vector spaces, linear independence, orthogonality, projection and spectrum.
* Identify linear algebraic structure in applications.
* Carry out computations such as determinant of a matrix and inverse of a matrix.
* Read and write rigorous mathematical proofs.
